# Yet Another Todo CLI

## Description

This is a simple todo CLI written in Go simply for practice. It allows you to add, mark a todo done/undone, remove, and list todo items. This is still in development and will be updated with more features. Once I'm happy with the CLI, I will document the repository more clearly.
